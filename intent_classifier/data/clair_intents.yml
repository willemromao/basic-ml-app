    - We're not there yet, but we're making progress.
    - I can't say for certain, but it seems plausible.
    - Not everyone agrees with this theory, but it has some merit.

    - you have to check if it contains or not
    - but is that little or not?

    - I'm reviewing what we discussed last week to catch up
    - Our project has multiple components that we need to integrate
    - I'm familiar with this concept, but applying it is a different story
    - It's challenging to correlate all these factors
    - I'm trying to align my understanding with the group's ideas
    - Our experiment has several stages, each important in its own right
    - I've noticed some trends, but I'm not drawing conclusions yet
    - This subject is new to me, so I'm learning as I go
    - We seem to be on the right track, but there's room for improvement
    - I've gathered the necessary resources, but I haven't analyzed them yet
    - What's the next step in our experiment?
    - Can someone clarify the objective of this task?
    - Who has the data from yesterday's survey?
    - We should schedule a meeting to discuss our findings
    - What does the textbook say about this theory?
    - How does this hypothesis compare to our initial assumptions?
    - We need to compile the results for a comprehensive analysis
    - What are the key variables in our study?
    - Who is responsible for documenting the project progress?
    - Let's distribute the tasks evenly among the team
    - Can we look at some examples for a better understanding?
    - It's important to verify the accuracy of these measurements
    - We should review the literature to find more relevant information
    - What resources can we use to support our hypothesis?
    - How do we plan to test the validity of this model?
    - It might be helpful to create a timeline for our project milestones
    - Can we brainstorm some potential solutions to this challenge?
    - What are the criteria for evaluating our project's success?
    - We need to ensure that all team members understand their roles
    - Let's summarize our findings before the next phase
